<p>Our platform connects players with the world's greatest entertainment.
We created GameHub in 2003 to serve as a digital content distribution channel, 
before app stores existed. It's since grown and evolved into a platform for thousands of creators 
and publishers to deliver content and establish direct relationships with their customers. 
<br><br>
The GameHub community enables millions of players to do likewise, 
sharing entertainment and ideas, and making friends.
Just as in software development, we conduct playtests and share prototypes with our partners and players. 
We follow the results of this work all the way through the manufacturing process to create products 
people are sure to enjoy.
<br><br>
At GameHub, we pour our hearts and souls into everything we create. 
We embrace our core values every day so that we can continue creating 
epic entertainment experiences for all our players. 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you're located—if you're a member of our evolving and vibrant community, 
working with us at one of our offices around the globe, or taking a piece of 
GameHub with you into space—you're welcome here. </p>
